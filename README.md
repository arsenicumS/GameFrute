#This version of the game is designed for 2 teams, part of the scenario is implemented offline in groups, the other part of the scenario is implemented by this application.
the point is that the teams are asked questions in turn, the correct answer makes it possible to choose any fruit any number of times, until 0 comes up or the player stops (a game of greed)
the team with the most points wins
